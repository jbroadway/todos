This is an example app for the [Elefant CMS](http://www.elefantcms.com/)
demoing how to integrate an Elefant-powered PHP site with the
[Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) Javascript
framework. Backbone.js is a client-side MVC framework for structuring
rich interactive user interfaces.

This app is based on the [Todos](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/tree/master/examples/todos)
Backbone.js example app written by [Jérôme Gravel-Niquet](http://jgn.me/).

To install, unzip it into your `apps` folder and you'll see "Todos (click to install)" appear in the
Elefant Tools menu. Click that link to complete the install process.

Once installed, you can access the Todos demo at `/todos` on your website.
